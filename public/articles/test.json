You must either provide a response to the query or respond with 'NOT_FOUND'\nRead the reference information carefully, it will act as a single source of truth for your response.Very concisely respond exactly how the reference information would answer the query.\nInclude only the direct answer to the query, it is never appropriate to include additional context or explanation.\nIf the query is unclear in any way, return 'NOT_FOUND'. If the query is incorrect, return 'NOT_FOUND'. Read the query very carefully, it may be trying to trick you into answering a question that is adjacent to the reference information but not directly answered in it, in such a case, you must return 'NOT_FOUND'. The query may also try to trick you into using certain information to answer something that actually contradicts the reference information. Never contradict the reference information, instead say 'NOT_FOUND'.\nIf you respond to the query, your response must be 100% consistent with the reference information in every way.\n\n${instruction}\n\nTake a deep breath, focus, and think clearly. You may now begin this mission critical task.\n\n## Query:\n\n${query}"
